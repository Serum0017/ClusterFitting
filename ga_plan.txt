ok so basically this is how stuff is going to work
This doc isn't meant to be comprehensible by anyone except me, but for anyone else looking at it, it's supposed to be a very technical description of how the GA will work.

Prune

- 330 arcseconds is about the max that a cluster can take up.
- delta density of oval w/ r 0.5 vs radius 1
- open/ glob clusters both exist, so there shouldn't be an assumed distribution. We should just measure density.

Probe

- generate isochrone fit curves as points
- spatial hash? (optimization to do later if time)
    - if we do use, then start with a sphere of radius 1. If there are no points, then double, until there are points. Then, once points are found, linearly search to find the best one.
        - without sp hash ofc we could linearly search for all points but that would be slow af and we're doing this a lot.
    - sp hash should only hash isochrone points, for lookup.
        - or maybe if its faster we can hash stars once (since they aren't changing) and then lookup stars from the isochrone??
- fitness function should be something like ((pointsIncluded / totalPts) ** 0.6) * avgPointFitness or some fancy stats instead of an average (maybe weighted avg)

- before running algo, we delete pulsators and white dwarfs from the dataset. Someone will need to fill me in on the specific research before i can implement this

Lets do it!
